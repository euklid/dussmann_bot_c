This is a command line program for ordering your food at http://www.dussmann-lpf.rcs.de . You have to
be a student at Landesschule Pforta in Saxony-Anhalt to have an account for this page. 
If anybody wants to improve this program, he can have my datas so that he can test it. Please restore
my orderings after experimentation.
For compiling you need the libcurl from curl.haxx.se . You can download it from http://curl.haxx.se/download.html .
The installation path in my case is /usr/include/curl and the flag it -lcurl .
compiling under Windows: -llibcurl and the .dll's have to be put into the folder where to compiled pro
gram is.

For execution under linux you need curl. Download it from the page above or install it from the repositories of your distribution.

The program asks you for you userid and your password. Both are numbers with four digits.
Then you are asked to choose the weeks you want to order and if you want do order for all days or not for all. If not, you have to choose the days.
Then it requests a rating for a part of food if this ingredient is not already in your ratings file. Please rate from 1 to 10 in integers.
Then all the magic happens and your food will be ordered.
